		<br><h1 style="text-align: center;">Propagation Channels</h1><br>
		<p>Propagation channels are at the core of any wireless system: they determine not only the ultimate performance limits, but also the relative merits of different systems, and even give guidelines of how systems should be designed. The first axiom of wireless systems is : <b><i>to design a wireless system, you must understand the channel in which it will operate.</i></b><br><br>
		The difficulties in wireless channel modeling are due to the complex propagation processes that form the basis of a wireless channel, involving reflections, scattering, diffraction, and transmission through a large number of irregular objects. For all practical purposes, it is thus necessary to derive simplified descriptions. The degree of admissible simplification, in turn, depends on the system for which the channel is intended. In the past 20 years, wireless systems have changed dramatically, from narrowband analogue systems, to MIMO wideband digital systems, and the deployment scenarios have expanded from cellular to WiFi, car-to-car, and internet of things. As the systems have evolved, so have the channel models needed for the design and evaluation.<br><br>
		WiDeS is one of the world’s leading institutions for the measurement and modeling of wireless propagation channels. Probably unique in the world, we deal with all aspects of this problem, from the design of measurement equipment, to performing measurement campaigns, to advanced signal processing for parameter extraction, to channel modeling; and we do that for channels ranging from distributed massive MIMO to car-to-car channels to millimeter-wave channels. <br><br>
		The following gives a high-level overview of our approach and capabilities; for details please see the related <a target="_blank" class="Hyperlinks" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W0wwrucAAAAJ">publications.</a></p>

	<p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">An example of our recent work is an ultrawideband, flexible channel sounder for distributed MIMO measurements. A block diagram is shown below. With a wideband (10 GHz bandwidth) arbitrary waveform generator, we are creating multi-tone sounding signals that are distributed, via an optical switch and radio-over-fiber systems, to 16 transmit antenna arrays, each of which consists of 16 antenna elements. A similar configuration uses 16-element arrays to measure received signals at 16 locations and haul them back to an ultra-high-speed digitizer, from where the signals are stored onto a RAID array for processing. Careful calibration allows extraction of channel properties with high-resolution parameter extraction algorithms (link to the HRPE section). <br><br></p>

	<p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">A millimeter-wave, real-time MIMO sounder is another key component of our measurement capability, since it allows the dynamic measurement of directional mm-wave characteristics. Compared to the traditional approach of mechanically rotating horn antennas and measuring the impulse response for each horn orientation, our sounder measures a million times faster. This enables the measurement of dynamic directional effects, e.g., how the direction from which the main power comes is changed when a bus is passing by. On the other hand, this also allows to measure in many different locations within a reasonable time (a recent campaign collected 20 million impulse responses in less than a day), thus enabling statistically relevant parameter extraction and modeling. <br><br>
	The sounder construction is based on the principle of switching beams electronically, instead of using mechanical rotation. The radio frequency units are constructed by Samsung Research America, and the sounder is the result of close collaboration between Samsung and WiDeS. Another key characteristic is the extreme phase stability (hard to achieve at millimeter-wave frequencies), which allows the application of HRPE.  <br><br></p><br>

		<p>Yet another sounder we recently built is a MIMO sounder for vehicle-to-vehicle measurements. To make it more robust and flexible, this sounder is based on software-defined radio (SDR) components from National Instruments. WiDeS members programmed the FPGAs, wrote the control software, and added antenna switching capability to create a sounder that can measure 8x8 MIMO channels at 800 MHz and 5.9 GHz, with a 160 MHz bandwidth.<br><br></p>

		<p><b style="font-size: 20px;">Measurement campaigns</b><br> It is important to keep in mind that a channel measurement is not simply taking a "channel sounder" and hitting the "start" button. Channel measurements require careful planning, proper selection of what is measured, where, and how often it is measured, and an understanding of what we ultimately want to extract from the measurements. Examples are shown in <a class="Hyperlinks" href="#mMIMO">massive MIMO</a>, <a class="Hyperlinks" href="mmChannels">mm-wave</a> and <a class="Hyperlinks" href="v2vChannels">V2V </a></p>

	<p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">HRPEs are based on a parametric model of the wireless propagation channel, namely that the (double-directional) impulse response consists of a sum of multipath components (MPCs), each of which is characterized by its amplitude, delay, and directions at transmitter and receiver. The task of the estimation algorithm is then to find the parameters of the MPCs from the measurement results of the channel sounders. The first class of algorithms we work with are iterative maximum-likelihood estimators, in particular the RiMax algorithm, an improved variant of the popular SAGE algorithm. RiMAX tends to converge significantly faster than SAGE when multiple signals with similar parameters are present, thanks to the implementation of the joint parameter optimization. For estimating the time evolution of channels, a novel HRPE algorithm based on the extended Kalman Filter (EKF) can exploit the correlation between multipath parameters to further improve the estimation accuracy. The algorithm also solves the association problem between MPCs from adjacent snapshots, and the outcome provides the evolution of signals while mobile terminals move.<br><br>

	Our main research in this field is -

		<li>Incorporating effects that have been neglected in previous, simplified, models, such as polarization, diffuse background radiation, change of antenna characteristics with bandwidth, and interdependency between delay and phase of the MPCs.</li>
		<li>Acceleration of the computations: since running an unoptimized maximum-likelihood estimator for a single snapshot (taken within a few ms) can take hours even on a fast computer, it is essential to find high-speed computation methods. Our work has already led to order-of-magnitude improvement in runtime, and we are continuing to find new methods to improve efficiency.</li>
	</ul><br></p>
	<p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Besides extracting the parameters of the MPCs, it is also important to identify “clusters”, ie., groups of MPCs that have similar characteristics and behavior.

While the model is now so widely accepted that this seems almost a matter of course, at the time of its introduction it was a paradigm shift away from the representation of the “transfer function matrix” that described in a MIMO system the transfer function from each transmit to each receive antenna element. Our current research revolves around large-scale variations of the double-directional impulse response, and whether it can be expanded into a finite sum of discrete contributions, or a "diffuse background" should be included.<br><br></p>

	<p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12" >Another direction of research revolves around "geometry-based stochastic channel models" (GSCMs). The basic principle is to statistically model the distribution of scatterers in space (by prescribing a probability density function of their location); impulse responses (including double-directional impulse responses) can then be found by a simplified ray tracing procedure that assumes that only single-scattering or double-scattering processes can occur. The origins of GSCMs go back to the 1970s, when a rings of scatterers around the MS was used to compute the effectiveness of diversity antennas at the BS. We were the first to generalize the model to the MIMO case, showing that many of the simplifications of the "diversity-antenna" scenario do not hold for MIMO, and proposing new modeling methods that solved this problem. Our current work focuses on adopting this model to the specific challenges of car-to-car propagation channels.<br><br></p>

Understanding the underlying channel is thus an essential task. While 3GPP has already established a model, it is oversimplified and only suitable for some rough comparisons between different systems, but is not suitable for assessing absolute performance. WiDeS is thus performing extensive measurement and modeling activities in the area, starting from the unique channel sounder we have constructed, to performing first-of-its-kind measurements, to bringing our results into standardization.<br><br></p>

For mm-wave systems depending on the beamforming gain, these temporal variations, especially the evolution of the angular spectra, are utmost importance while designing efficient beam-discovery and beam-switching algorithms. Figure (3) shows a sample measurement in a time varying channel. In this example, where we observe two main MPCs while the channel is idle; the LOS path and a reflection as shown the figure, then a bus blocks these two dominant paths as it moves along street. The effects of blockage on the mean angles and the angular spreads are also shown in Figure (3).<br><br>Furthermore, Figure (4) shows the PDP from another measurement location in which there are several moving scatterers in the environment. These measurements give insight on omnidirectional and directional delay spread and their evolution as the channel changes.</p>

Unlike the common belief, since there is no strong LOS component, all NLOS MPCs experience similar power decay with frequency and hence the RMS delay spreads does not change significantly with frequency.</p>

Different from the typical car-to-car propagation channel, the figure suggests that the presence of the trailer, which is higher than the antenna,  provides a strong reflection that is acting as a mirrored component to the line-of-sight path.<br><br></p>

Results were evaluated with our high-resolution (RiMax) algorithm, and provided not only the directions and delays of the discrete multipath components, but also, for the first time in urban environments, the parameterization of the diffuse multipath.

	An exciting challenge in wireless system design is the need to merge insights from many different disciplines. From communication theory to networking, optimization theory, to physics, system design requires both broad and deep thinking.<br><br>
	WiDeS has established itself as a pioneer in a number of select topics, namely MIMO systems (particularly reduced-complexity MIMO transceivers, wireless video distribution, ultrawideband communication and localization, and novel modulation and multiplexing methods (particularly OAM and OTFS). In all of these fields we follow our philosophy of finding innovative approaches that are inspired by practical applications, but grounded in solid theory.

	<ul>
		<li><b>Femtocaching</b>, where a small base station without backhaul link, but with a large cache, stores popular files, and transmits them upon demand to the users. Since those stations do not need backhaul, they are extremely cheap to deploy, and since they can be placed with high density, result in high spectral efficiency.</li>
		<li><b>Caching on devices together with device-to-device communications</b>: The concept of femtocaching can be pushed further by caching video files on the user devices themselves – while the caches would not be large enough to store all the videos a particular person might want to watch, the aggregate cache of the users in a particular area is large enough. Then, a user can get a required file via spectrally efficient D2D communication from another device, without having to go via the base station.</li>

		<li><b>Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) multiplexing</b> : OAM can be interpreted as a “phase twist” imposed on a wave propagating down the axis. Different OAM “modes” with different phase twists (but propagating down the same axis) are orthogonal to each other, and thus can carry different data streams. This feature is especially useful for line-of-sight links that need to carry several Gbit/s. A key advantage of OAM modes is that they can be separate by analog components, thus obviating the need for spatial equalizers operating at ultra-high computational speeds. In collaboration with Prof. Alan Willner (link), the pioneer of OAM, we have worked on theory and prototyping of OAM in the mm-wave regime, and – inter alia – demonstrated 32 GBit/s transmission in the 28 GHz band.</li><br>
