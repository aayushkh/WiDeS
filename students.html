	<h2 style="text-align: center;">Directed Research Projects</h2><br>
	<p>Directed Research is a great opportunity for MS and undergraduate students to gather first-hand experience in cutting-edge research. DR projects are always closely tied to larger research projects going on in our group, ensuring that the problems are pertinent, and there is intense interaction with faculty and PhD students; in many cases DR students can be (co)authors of publications resulting from their work.<br><br>
	We only accept applications for specific projects listed below (if no projects are listed, we don’t have anything available – please check back regularly). When applying for a project, please make sure to point out your skills/experience that is especially relevant for this specific project – don’t just send in a generic CV.<br><br></p>

		<h2 style="text-align: center;">Prospective PhD students, PostDocs, and Visitors</h2><br>
		<div id="#benefit-one"><h3>Announcment - PostDoc position in mm-wave/THz measurement available</h3>
			The WiDeS group at the University of Southern California has a position available for a PostDoc in the area of mm-wave and THz channel measurement and modeling. Experience with mm-wave/THz measurement equipment (VNA, etc.) is essential; experience in channel measurement and modeling is beneficial but not a prerequisite. Please send your application to <a class="Hyperlinks" href="founder.html">Prof. Andy Molisch</a>, molisch@usc.edu, and ensure that your cover letter describes in detail your measurement expertise and experience.  
		</div>
		<div id="#benefit-one"><h3>Why become a student or PostDoc at WiDeS</h3>
			The Viterbi School at USC is one of the top engineering schools in the USA, and WiDeS is proud to be a part of this great environment. In this tradition, we perform cutting-edge research that has a high profile – many of our papers are highly cited or gain best-paper awards, and thus create a solid basis for the future careers of our PhD students and PostDocs. Our alumni are now professors in academia, work in the research departments of companies ranging from Amazon to Google to Intel, or are key members of startups.<br><br>
			At WiDeS, we subscribe to the following principles -
			<ul>
				<li>comply to the <a class="Hyperlinks" href="rulebook.html">"rulebook"</a> of WiDeS.</li>
				<li><i>close collaborations between the group members</i> : collaborations almost always enhance the output of everybody involved. We encourage information exchange between all group members. Every group member will participate in weekly meetings. Also, weekly meetings with Prof. Molisch are part of the routine.</li>
				<li><i>non-hierarchical thinking</i> : scientific ideas are judged on their merits, not according to who suggested them. That is the good thing about science: there is an objectively correct answer. Side note: Administrative questions are, naturally, decided by project leaders and the head of group.</li>
				<li><i>interest in practical applications</i> : the group deals with a wide range of topics, ranging from pure measurements to quite theoretical work. But ultimately, everything has to have a relation to the physical reality, and you are encouraged to spend at least some time to think about those relationships. You are also encouraged to spend at least one or two summers in an industrial research lab, and we will help you to land such an internship.</li>
			</ul><br>
			If you feel that you fit in well in such an atmosphere, you are interested in our <a class="Hyperlinks" href="research.html">research areas </a>, and you have the "hard skills" to contribute to world-class research, then please fill out the application form <a class="Hyperlinks" href="">here </a> and you will be contacted later.<br><br><br>
		</div>
		<div id="#benefit-two"><h3>Open positions for PhD Students and PostDocs</h3>
			There are currently no specified calls for PhD students, though I will be accepting new students in the fall 2018. If you want to apply, please check the section <a class="Hyperlinks" href="#benefit-one">Why become a student or PostDoc at WiDeS.</a><br>
			There are currently no specific calls for PostDocs. If you have external funding and want to become a visitor, please check the section <a class="Hyperlinks" href="#benefit-three">For Prospective Visitors.</a><br><br><br></div>
		<div id="#benefit-three"><h3>For Prospective Visitors</h3>
			WiDeS is proud of its many international collaborations, and are positive to hosting visitors. However, please note that the Viterbi-school is space-limited, and therefore limits on the number of visitors, as well as strict procedures for the approval of visitors by the dean, are in place. This holds for all visitors, from PhD students to PostDocs, to faculty. <br><br>
			If you want to visit WiDeS, the first step is to send an email to Prof. Molisch with a description of what you envision for your visit. Please do not send a generic “Dear sir…” letter – it will not be considered. Elaborate why a visit would be productive, where you see the synergies between your work and the work going on at WiDeS, etc. It should form the basis of a detailed research plan that will be worked out between you and us if the synergies look promising. <br><br>
			Finally, please note that as per USC policy, visiting PhD students with scholarships from CSC cannot be accepted (students with funding from their home universities, or PostDocs/faculty with CSC funding are ok).<br><br><br></div>
