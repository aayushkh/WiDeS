		<h2>About  WiDeS</h2><br>
		<p>WiDeS is dedicated to research that is both scientifically challenging and practically relevant. The main emphasis of our research is on the physical layer of wireless communications, but we also deal with overall wireless systems integration, networking, and cross-layer design. Our philosophy is to bridge the main chasms in today's wireless research.<br>
		The WiDeS group was founded in January 2009 by Andy Molisch, when he joined the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, after a career in both industry (AT&T Bell Labs, Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs), and academia (Lund University, Technical University Vienna). WiDeS is a part of the Communications Sciences Institute of the Department of Electrical Engineering at USC, and is affiliated with the ULTRA-Lab at USC.<br><br></p>
		<p><b><i>Theoretical vs. Industrial</i></b><br><br>
		There is often the misconception that theoretical work cannot be practically relevant. But in order to build systems that not only work, but are also better than the competition, new research, dedicated to the specific goals of the system, is required. Members of the group have many years experience in industrial research labs and standardization of wireless systems.<br><br>
		<b><i>Theoretical vs. Experimental</i></b><br><br> 
		Theoretical breakthroughs are often made on paper, but they have to be verified by experiments - that is one of the basic tenets of science, though it is sometimes forgotten even in engineering research. Careful design of experiments, knowledge of best measurement procedures and innovations in the evaluation methods of large-scale measurements are all vital components of today's wireless research.<br><br>
		<b><i>Communication Theory vs. Antennas/Propagation</i></b><br><br>
		Wireless propagation channels determine system performance, while conversely channel investigations have to pay attention to the system they are intended for. Therefore, WiDeS puts great emphasis on suitably combining these two strands of research.

Making their way to the bustling technology hub of Singapore, 4 WiDeS members presented papers: Umit Bas two papers on mm-wave channel measurements (joint work with Samsung), Zheda Li gave a talk on hybrid transceivers (joint work with Beihang), Vishnu Ratnam presented work on reduced complexity receivers for ultrawideband (joint work with KACST), and Andy Molisch presented papers on body area network and wireless video distribution systems. He also participated in a panel discussion on the future of communications, and gave keynotes at the workshops on mm-wave systems (Monday) and massive MIMO (Friday).</p></span>

			            	<span class="hidden-xs"><p class="carousel three textNews hidden"> The IET, the largest engineering society in the UK, announced today the following:  “The IET Achievement Medal for wireless communications to Professor F. Andreas Molisch FIET, Professor and Solomon-Golomb - Andrew-and-Erna-Viterbi Chair, University of Southern California, USA. Over the last 20 years Professor Molisch has made major contributions to wireless communications, bridging industry and academia, and furthered interest in wireless communications through textbooks and tutorials. Professor Molisch is one of the world's leading experts on wireless propagation channels, having created, e.g., the "double-directional channel model" that has become the standard modeling approach for describing MIMO channels. He has also made profound contributions in wireless transceiver and system design, and some of his work will be part of the 5G standard, paving the way for future generations of wireless communication. </p></span>

An expert in stochastic network optimization, Hao developed new systems and techniques ranging from information accumulation in ad-hoc networks to optimization of joint computation and communication. Results were published in prestigious venues such as the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Infocom, and Asilomar, and he received a best-paper award at IEEE ICC, the flagship conference of the Communcations Society. Hao will join Intel research in January. </p></span>
